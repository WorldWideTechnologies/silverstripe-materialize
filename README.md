Materialize Framework intregrated with SilverStripe - It's just a boiler now

This is the integrations of the Materialized CSS Framework with the SilverStripe Framework.


I love material and i love SS. So, why not put them together?

So here we are, this is just my first release, need optimisation and cleanup. I'm not a programmer,
I just try to create my first project, so someone maybe could help me with basic stuff. 

Thanks a lot 

Oh, right, Materialize it's under MIT Lic.
